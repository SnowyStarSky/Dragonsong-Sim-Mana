### v1.0.5 Changelog:
	- Added option to pick Limit Cut numbers/arrows.
	- Added option to pick first Mortal Vow Target.
	- Fixed APD/LPDU Wroth spread positions. Added in-game option for static (APD/LPDU) and facing middle (Twin).
	- Moved Wroth starting position slightly off E/W wall to better match movement without sprint.


### v1.0.4 Changelog:
	- Fixed a crash during P6-Cauterize.
	- Added options for target markers:
		- Standard Auto-Marker: links outside, ignores inside, 1-4 spread (default for APD/LPDU).
		- Manual markers: uses fewer markers, link1+ignore1 = outside pair, no marker = inside pair.
		- No markers: be warned, there is no priority and it's fully random where bots decide to go.
	- Reconfigured some settings. If you run into any issues, try deleting the "DSR Sim" folder, located in your %appdata% folder.
